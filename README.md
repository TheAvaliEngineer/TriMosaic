# TriMosaic
TriMosaic is a program that'll interpret bitmaps into Brainfuck code. It's written by creating 'mosaics' of
triangles (although you need not necessarily do that, considering it doesn't check for continuity between
corners.) More is explained in the documentation, which is automatically created by the python script once
you run it.
